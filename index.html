                    <p class="tribute-text">
                        Stan Lee (born Stanley Martin Lieber December 28, 1922 – November 12, 2018) was an American comic book writer, editor,
                        publisher, and producer. He rose through the ranks of a family-run business to become Marvel Comics' primary creative leader
                        for two decades, leading its expansion from a small division of a publishing house to a multimedia corporation that dominated
                        the comics industry.

                    <p class="tribute-text">
                        In collaboration with others at Marvel—particularly co-writer/artists Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko—he co-created numerous
                        popular fictional characters, including superheroes Spider-Man, the X-Men, Iron Man, Thor, the Hulk, Black Widow, the
                        Fantastic Four, Black Panther, Daredevil, Doctor Strange, Scarlet Witch and Ant-Man. The superheroes he created seemed more
                        meaningful and realistic. In doing so, he pioneered a more naturalistic approach to writing superhero comics in the 1960s, and
                        in the 1970s he challenged the restrictions of the Comics Code Authority, indirectly leading to changes in its policies. In
                        the 1980s he pursued the development of Marvel properties in other media, with mixed results. Following his retirement from
                        Marvel in the 1990s, he remained a public figurehead for the company, and frequently made cameo appearances in films and
                        television shows based on Marvel characters, on which he received an executive producer credit. Meanwhile, he continued
                        independent creative ventures into his 90s, until his death in 2018.

                        Lee was inducted into the comic book industry's Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame in 1994 and the Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in
                        1995. He received the NEA's National Medal of Arts in 2008.

                        Lee died on November 12, 2018, six weeks before his 96th birthday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California,
                        after being rushed there in a medical emergency earlier in the day. Earlier that year, Lee revealed to the public that he had
                        been battling pneumonia and in February was rushed to the hospital for worsening conditions at around the same time. The
                        immediate cause of death listed on his death certificate was cardiac arrest with respiratory failure and congestive heart
                        failure as underlying causes. It also indicated that he suffered from "aspiration pneumonia." His body was cremated and his
                        ashes were given to his daughter.
